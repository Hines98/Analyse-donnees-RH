# HR Analysis Dashboard
This is a PBI project titled 

## Problem Statement
The HR (Human Resource) department is the heart of every organization. From recruitment to compensation to performance appraisal and employee wellbeing, the HR department plays several roles in the enterprise. HR acts as a mediator or a bridge between the employees and the management or enterprise. It’s no surprise that the HR department is already burdened with work. Providing them access to the latest technology and the means to derive insights in real time will help reduce the workload and create a healthy environment throughout the organization.
Market fluctuations and rapidly changing technology have affected the global market. Many published reports showed that around half of the employees wanted to change jobs. While some market researchers said that flexible working and job security were their primary factors, few admitted that a higher salary was their aim.
Different regions saw an increase and a decrease in salaries over the years. While the increase was to retain top-level professional employees, the pay cuts were due to market fluctuations and were resorted after the market conditions improved. HR people across the globe are hiring new employees, trying to retain and understand the needs of employees who got separated (those who left the company).
So, how does the HR department make these decisions in volatile market conditions? They rely on HR analytics to understand the existing situation and develop a new modern approach. 

## Objective
The objective of this project is to create a dashboard that addresses the challenges faced by HR professionals and provides an effective way to answer their daily questions. The dashboard will offer real-time insights into active employees, new hires, separations, and other key metrics to support strategic decision-making.
This tool aims to enable HR to:
•	Track employee trends: Hiring, separations, and active employees.
•	Analyze demographic and performance data: Distribution of employees by gender, age, and tenure.
